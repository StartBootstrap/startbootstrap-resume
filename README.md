# [My Resume](https://rheo-.github.io/kabir/)

I am just using this theme to build my own profile: [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) is a resume and CV theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume.
